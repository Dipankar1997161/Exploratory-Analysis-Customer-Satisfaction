In-depth EDA and customer sentiment analysis


## Introduction

Customers interact with your business or service every day, and the quality of the interaction experience can get your brand ahead. Brands that want to stay in the game and advance in the market know that they need to continuously listen to the customers to provide services in line with customer expectations.

Using customer data to improve customer experience can help retain customers, which is more straightforward than acquiring new customers. A happy customer will not only return to your service but is likely to promote your company through word of mouth.

With data science, businesses can easily collect the right data, find models of positive customer journeys, and many more. Furthermore, companies can develop a customer experience that reflects their goals by understanding what is most valuable to their prospects.
